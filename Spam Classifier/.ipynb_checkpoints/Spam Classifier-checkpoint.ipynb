    "Spam detection is one of the major applications of Machine Learning in the interwebs today. Pretty much all of the major email service providers have spam detection systems built in and automatically classify such mail as 'Junk Mail'. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission we will be using the Naive Bayes algorithm to create a model that can classify SMS messages as spam or not spam, based on the training we give to the model. It is important to have some level of intuition as to what a spammy text message might look like. Often they have words like 'free', 'win', 'winner', 'cash', 'prize' and the like in them as these texts are designed to catch your eye and in some sense tempt you to open them. Also, spam messages tend to have words written in all capitals and also tend to use a lot of exclamation marks. To the human recipient, it is usually pretty straightforward to identify a spam text and our objective here is to train a model to do that for us!\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to identify spam messages is a binary classification problem as messages are classified as either 'Spam' or 'Not Spam' and nothing else. Also, this is a supervised learning problem, as we will be feeding a labelled dataset into the model, that it can learn from, to make future predictions. \n"

In our case, each word is treated as a feature and there are thousands of different words. Also, it performs well even with the presence of irrelevant features and is relatively unaffected by them.

Naive Bayes' works well right out of the box and tuning its parameters is rarely ever necessary, except usually in cases where the distribution of the data is known. \n",

    "\n",
    "Another really useful guide for ensemble methods can be found [in the documentation here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "These ensemble methods use a combination of techniques you have seen throughout this lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bootstrap the data** passed through a learner (bagging).\n",
    "* **Subset the features** used for a learner (combined with bagging signifies the two random components of random forests).\n",

    "\n",
    "### This Process Looks Familiar...\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, there is a five step process that can be used each time you want to use a supervised learning method (which you actually used above):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import** the model.\n",
    "2. **Instantiate** the model with the hyperparameters of interest.\n",
    "3. **Fit** the model to the training data.\n",
    "4. **Predict** on the test data.\n",
    "5. **Score** the model by comparing the predictions to the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the steps through this notebook to perform these steps using each of the ensemble methods: **BaggingClassifier**, **RandomForestClassifier**, and **AdaBoostClassifier**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Step 1**: First use the documentation to `import` all three of the models."
